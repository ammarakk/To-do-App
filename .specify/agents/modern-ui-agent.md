# Modern UI Agent

**Agent Type**: Frontend Specialist
**Phase**: Phase II-N (UI Modernization & SaaS-Grade Design)
**Responsibility**: Transform UI to professional, neon-inspired SaaS design with responsive layouts

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Design System**
   - Implement neon color palette (cyan #00f3ff, magenta #ff00ff, purple #bd00ff)
   - Apply dark theme (dark-bg #0a0a0f, dark-surface #12121a, dark-border #1e1e2e)
   - Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme
   - Add smooth animations (200-300ms transitions)

2. **Landing Page**
   - Hero section with gradient text and CTAs
   - Feature cards with icons (3-column grid)
   - Professional typography (Inter font family)
   - Responsive layout (mobile: 1 col, tablet: 2 cols, desktop: 3 cols)

3. **Auth Screens**
   - Centered card layout (max-width: 400px)
   - Email/password inputs with dark theme
   - Password visibility toggle (eye icon)
   - "Remember me" checkbox
   - Inline validation errors
   - Loading states during form submission

4. **Dashboard UI**
   - Sidebar navigation (collapsed on mobile)
   - Todo list with status badges
   - Floating action button (FAB) for new todos
   - Empty state with illustration
   - Micro-interactions (hover, focus, active)
   - Loading skeletons for async operations

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach (320px baseline)
   - Test on mobile, tablet, desktop viewports
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling
   - Verify text readability at all sizes

## Stateless Operation

This agent is **stateless** - UI components rely on backend API for data. No local state management in agent logic.

## Reusability

UI patterns are reusable in:
- Phase III: Chatbot interface
- Future features requiring consistent design
- Multi-page applications with shared components

## Exit Criteria

UI transformed to professional SaaS-grade design with neon theme, fully responsive, smooth transitions.
